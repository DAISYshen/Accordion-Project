<!-- <p>There is only a limited amount of food you can eat in a single day. In order to maximize the amount of nutrients you take in, it makes sense to spend your "calorie budget" wisely.
The best way to do that is to simply eat the foods that carry the greatest amount and variety of nutrients.</p> -->
  <dl class="container">
    <dt>Salmon</dt>
    <dd>
        <img src="images/Salmon.png" width="170"height="170" alt="salmon"/>
        <p>Salmon, and other fatty types of fish, contain the greatest amount of Omega-3s.
        Omega-3 fatty acids are extremely important for the optimal function of your body. They're linked to improved wellbeing and a lower risk of many serious diseases.
        It is a good idea to eat fatty fish at least once or twice a week, to get all the Omega-3s that your body (and brain) desperately need.
        Studies show that the people who eat fatty fish regularly have a lower risk of heart disease, dementia, depression and plethora of common diseases.
        Also, let's not forget the fact that salmon tastes awesome and is fairly simple to prepare. It also tends to make you feel full with relatively few calories.</p>

    <dt>Seaweed</dt>
    <dd>
        <img src="images/seaweed.png" width="170"height="170" alt="salmon"/>
        <p>The sea has more than just fish... it also contains massive amounts of vegetation.
        Usually referred to as "seaweed," there are thousands of different plant species in the ocean, some of which are incredibly nutritious.
        In many cases, seaweed is even more nutritious than vegetables from the land. It is particularly high in minerals like Calcium, Iron, Magnesium and Manganese.
        It is also loaded with various bioactive compounds, including phycocyanins and carotenoids. Some of these substances are antioxidants with powerful anti-inflammatory activity.
        Just eating a high-iodine seaweed like kelp a few times per month can give your body all the iodine that it needs.</p>

    <dt>Garlic</dt>
    <dd>
        <img src="images/garlic2.png" width="170"height="160" alt="salmon"/>
        <p>Garlic really is an amazing ingredient.
            Not only can it turn all sorts of bland dishes into delicious treats, it is also incredibly nutritious.
            It is high in vitamins C, B1 and B6, Calcium, Potassium, Copper, Manganese and Selenium.
            But garlic is also loaded with another incredibly important nutrient called Allicin, which is the active ingredient in garlic.
            It also has various cancer-fighting properties. Studies show that the people who eat a lot of garlic have a much lower risk of several common cancers, especially cancers of the colon and stomach.
            Garlic is also very potent at killing pathogens like bacteria and fungi.</p>

    <dt>Potato</dt>
    <dd>
      <img src="images/Potato.png"width="130"height="170" alt="potato">
        <p>If there's one high-carb food that I miss on my low-carb diet, it's potatoes.
        Potatoes really are one of the world's most perfect foods.
        They contain a little bit of almost every nutrient we need and there have been accounts of people living on nothing but potatoes for a long time.
        If you cook the potatoes and then allow them to cool afterwards, they also form large amounts of resistant starch, a fiber-like substance with many powerful health benefits.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Blueberry</dt>
    <dd>
        <img src="images/blueberry.png" width="100"height="100" alt="salmon"/>
        <p>When it comes to the nutritional value of fruits, blueberries are in a league of their own.
        They are loaded with powerful antioxidant substances, including anthocyanins and various phytochemicals, some of which can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert protective effects on the brain.
        Several studies have examined the health effects of blueberries in humans.</p>
